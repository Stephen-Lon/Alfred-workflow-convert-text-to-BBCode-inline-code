# Alfred-workflow-convert-text-to-BBCode-inline-code
This simple workflow works on selected text as a Universal Action and converts the selected text to a simulation of inline code. It is designed for use on forums (like the Alfred forum) which use BBCode.

# Usage

Write your forum post and then select, one by one, each piece of text which you wish to simulate as inline code. Run this workflow from Universal Actions on each selected piece of text.

See the workflow configuration for screen shots.
